# PF-NET: a neural network to predict the protein family of input sequences

PF-NET is a multi-layer neural network, consisting of a CNN, attention layer, and a biLSTM, that accurately annotates sequences from 996 protein families. We selected 996 protein families from Pfam (https://pfam.xfam.org/), focusing on protein families within the plant and animal kingdom, and extracted accompanying sequences from Pfam's underlying sequence database. The total training dataset consisted of 7,385,028 sequences, covering the entire tree of life.
